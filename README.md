# 📊 Employee Performance and Retention Analysis

This project explores employee performance and attrition trends using data visualization and machine learning techniques. It includes descriptive analysis, interactive plots, and predictive modeling with a focus on understanding key factors affecting performance and retention.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Visualize employee performance trends by department, salary, and experience.
- Identify patterns of attrition across different roles and features.
- Train and evaluate predictive models for performance and attrition.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **pandas** – Data manipulation
- **numpy** – Numerical computing
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **plotly** – Static and interactive visualizations
- **scikit-learn** – Data preprocessing and machine learning
- **tensorflow** – Neural network modeling with Keras

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Line Plots showing performance trends over time
- Bar Charts for department-wise attrition counts
- Scatter Plots correlating salary and performance
- Boxplots and histograms to explore feature distributions
- Confusion matrix and model evaluation curves

---

## 🧠 Models Used

The notebook is structured to support training models such as:

- Linear Regression for predicting performance scores
- Random Forest or other classifiers for predicting attrition
- Keras-based Neural Networks for both classification and regression tasks
